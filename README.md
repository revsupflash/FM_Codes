# FM_Codes
This repository contains the following projects,along with commments explaning each line/function of the code:
1. Print the following output.
*
**
***
****
*****
2. Take a String, integer, char, double input from user and print it.
3. Print the sequence shown in Q1 but the number of rows should be decided by the user.
4. Take a String input and count the number of vowels in it.
5. Implement Bubble sort and Selection sort. Take the input from the user.

a. Addition
b. Subtraction
c. Multiplication
d. Division
e. Trigonometry
f. Exponential
7. Check the String if it is Palindrome or not.
8. Do the Q5 again by implementing the bubble sort algorithm in a separate function.
9. Take an Array from the user and print the size of the array.
10. Take each element of the 4x4 matrix from the user and print it, then add each element
from the 2D matrix and print the sum, print the sum of both the diagonals.

The coding has been performed and executed via vs code, source of learning being YT
